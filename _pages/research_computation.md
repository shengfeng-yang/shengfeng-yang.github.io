We develop defect-aware predictive digital twins for engineering materials, including semiconductor materials, advanced packaging, and battery materials, leveraging advanced modeling and simulation to capture defect initiation, evolution, and their effects on performance and reliability.

Reliability for Semiconductor Advanced Packaging with Defects:
------
We utilize computational simulations and machine learning techniques to model failure mechanisms in semiconductor advanced packaging, aiming to improve the reliability predictions and performance of microelectronic devices.

Modeling Defects in Battery Materials:
------
We use advanced computational modeling and simulation to understand and engineer defect–structure–property relationships, guiding the design of next-generation lithium-ion batteries, solid-state electrolytes, and beyond.

Simulating Defects at Materials Interfaces:
------
We investigate how defects—including dopants, impurities, vacancies, and dislocations—influence material properties and performance at critical interfaces such as grain boundaries and phase boundaries. Through advanced atomistic and multi-scale simulations, we aim to uncover the fundamental mechanisms governing defect nucleation, segregation, migration, and interaction at these interfaces.

Concurrent Atomistic-Continuum Methods for Defect Dynamics:
------
We develop advanced multiscale simulation methodologies that seamlessly bridge atomistic and continuum scales. These frameworks enable efficient and accurate prediction of defect nucleation, migration, and interaction in microstructurally complex materials.
