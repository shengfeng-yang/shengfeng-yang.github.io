Welcome to the Advanced Computation and Artificial Intelligence (ACAI) Lab at Purdue University, led by Dr. Shengfeng Yang. Our vision is to build **Reliable Physical AI that learns in simulation and performs in the real world**.

We develop Physical AI models that bridge the gap between simulation and reality. By combining high-fidelity physics simulations, advanced machine learning, and real-world validation, we build predictive models that are both accurate and computationally efficient. Our research spans across scales: from predicting atomic-level defects in materials to enabling complex robot manipulation in unstructured environments. This strategy reduces the reliance on resource-intensive experiments while ensuring real-world reliability.

Our Three Research Areas:
