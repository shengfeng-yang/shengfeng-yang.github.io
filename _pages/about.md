Welcome to the website of the Advanced Computation and Artificial Intelligence (AC&AI) Lab, led by Dr. Shengfeng Yang at Purdue University. Our lab is dedicated to advancing research through advanced computation and machine learning techniques in the following areas:

Failure and Reliability Analysis for Microelectronics
======
We employ computational simulations and machine learning techniques to model the failure mechanisms of semiconductor materials and enhance the reliability predictions of microelectronics.

Design Materials for Sustainable Energy
======
Our research harnesses advanced computational techniques to design state-of-the-art materials and structures, meeting the needs of diverse engineering fields for sustainable energy, including nuclear energy and Li-ion batteries.

Interfaces in Engineering Materials
======
We investigate the impact of various interfaces on the properties of engineering materials to uncover the underlying mechanisms, thereby enabling the design of advanced materials through interfacial engineering.

Robotic Manipulation
======
We focus on developing advanced and efficient algorithms specifically designed for robotic manipulation across diverse engineering applications.
