<a href="/research_computation" style="font-size: 25px; font-weight: bold;">Computational Modeling and Simulation of Materials</a>
======
We utilize atomic-level computational simulations to model materials for various engineering applications.

<a href="/research_AI" style="font-size: 25px; font-weight: bold;">Scientific Machine Learning</a>
======
We develop advanced scientific machine learning algorithms for a wide range of applications.

<a href="/research_robotics" style="font-size: 25px; font-weight: bold;">Physical Intelligence and Robotics</a>
======
This project develops advanced Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for physical intelligence on the Mobile ALOHA platform. By integrating multimodal perception, language understanding, and adaptive control, we aim to enable autonomous and intelligent real-world task execution.
