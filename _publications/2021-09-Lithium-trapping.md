Irreversible capacity loss is a critical problem in high capacity anode materials of Li-ion batteries, such as silicon, germanium, and tin. In addition to solid electrolyte interface formation and active material loss, Li trapping in high capacity anode materials during cycling has been considered a new mechanism of capacity loss but received less attention. In this study, we used single particle battery-based in situ focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning TEM to investigate the microstructure and composition of germanium nanopores formed at the end of delithiation. Our results show that a significant amount of Li accumulates inside the nanopores.
